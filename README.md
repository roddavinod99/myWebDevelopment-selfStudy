# myWebDevelopment-selfStudy
This repository contains all my web development commits reguarding what I learned form time to time when I have time ot learn web development. The Days may vary because of not having time available for me to commit it to the GitHub.
I will do the commits in bulk like once every two or three days as i need to leaarn two or three concepts to make a commit since it can be way too munch for my laptop to make the commits for every day.
